# multithreading_test
Simple exercise on studies. 

Simple proof of multithreading superiority presented during apply blur effect on simple picture. 

Time to apply blur effect on picture without multithreading is 0.0786 sec.

And with multithreading (3 cores used) takes 0.0380 sec. 

So multithreading in this case saves about 0.04 sec! Think about 1000 pictures:)
